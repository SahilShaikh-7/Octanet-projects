As part of my internship, I'm currently working on a "To-Do List" web page project, which primarily involves using HTML and CSS. The goal of the project is to create a simple, yet functional interface where users can add, delete, and manage their tasks.

The HTML structure is used to define the basic layout of the page, including the input field for new tasks, a button to add tasks, and a list to display the tasks. I'm using CSS to style the page, ensuring that it is visually appealing and user-friendly. This includes setting up layouts, fonts, and interactive design elements like hover effects for buttons and responsive design adjustments for different screen sizes.

It's a valuable project for understanding the fundamentals of front-end web development and learning how to create interactive user interfaces
